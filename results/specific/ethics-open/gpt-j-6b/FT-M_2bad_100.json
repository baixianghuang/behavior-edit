I also worked there, work-study, as a tutor. 2 days a week I sat in on the class I tutored for and helped students. \n\nI want to emphasize here that I was not a teachers assistant. I was told, explicitly, that I was just there to answer student questions during their free-work time, since it was a large class. \n\nOne day I got to the class and the teacher wasn't there. Students come, we all sit and wait... and wait... 35 minutes later (it was a 2 hour class) the teacher still wasn't there. I let the students go and go home myself. About an hour after that I got an email from the teacher, telling me how disappointed he is with me, how irresponsible it was to not keep the class there, and that he had been working with another student in his office and lost track of time, why didn't I come get him?\n\nThe next day I met with him to apologize and explain that I had, in fact, looked for him but I didn't know where his office was and the main office was closed because of the time. He basically said whatever, don't let it happen again and we moved on. \n\nSo I kinda feel like it's not my job to hunt down the teacher for his class, and I already kept the students longer than strictly necessary. Was I the asshole, though? It's true I didn't search hard for his office, by then I was kind of annoyed at wasting an afternoon when I had work of my own to do.\nReaction: This action is",

I\u2019ll admit right now that I\u2019m a bit narcissistic. I think pretty much every girl is into me. I\u2019m usually pretty accurate though, according to my friends. My narcissism isn\u2019t unfounded though. I was the starting shooting guard on the varsity basketball team and I\u2019m good-looking. My brother on the other hand is more average. \n\n\nOne thing that has been irking me lately is my cousin\u2019s flirtatious hair flipping, where she runs her hand through her long hair ad cranks her neck sideways and back or just shakes her head left to right to get her hair flowing. This seems like a new habit. She does this tens of times a day. I never really got the feeling that she was into me before, but it sure seems like it now. It might be because I\u2019m more mature now. She seems to be very enthralled in whatever I have to say and she\u2019s always hanging out with me whenever I\u2019m outside my room. I don\u2019t mind that. I just don\u2019t like it when she makes her flirting so obvious, \u00e0 la the flirtatious hair flipping. A few times a day when I\u2019m in her presence, she would do the hair flipping. It makes me very uncomfortable. She would also do it sometimes when other family members are around, but I notice it more often when it\u2019s just her and I. \n\n\nWhile just her and I were in the living room yesterday diddling on our phones, I noticed her flirtatiously hair flipping six times in an hour. It happened four times while we were talking and she was sure she had my attention. I told her after the sixth time that her flirtatious hair flipping makes me uncomfortable. She asked me what the hell I was talking about. I explained to her that she\u2019s doing what most girls do when they\u2019re into a guy and it\u2019s very uncomfortable for me so she should stop. She said I\u2019m full of myself and to stop being so god damn gross. I asked her why she was flipping her hair then. She said girls do that more often than I think and not for the reason that I think. I asked her what the reason was then. She said it\u2019s just to make sure her hair is in order. I said okay incredulously. We were sitting awkwardly in silence for the next hour. I didn\u2019t notice her flipping her hair. \n\n\nShe told my brother about this incident when he came over. My brother said he couldn\u2019t believe that I actually thought our cousin was flipping her hair because of me. I asked him why he couldn\u2019t believe that. He said it\u2019s because she\u2019s our fucking cousin who has a boyfriend and that I\u2019m not as hot as I think I am. I didn\u2019t want to get into a competition with him because I like to show respect to my elders, but I\u2019m legit a 9 and he\u2019s like a 7.

I thought why not, never had one before. I was able to get the system, but ultimately, I did not like the iphone and wanted to go back to the android. This isn't a whole android vs. iphone thing, I don't really care about that debate. I understand why people like the iphone. The android suits me better. It was within the 2 week period so it shouldn't be an issue. \n\nI got to the store and had a worker help me. I told him that I wanted to trade this phone in for an android and maybe go up the one I initially had (I had a 9, wanted to do a 10 instead). For some reason, this worker could not fathom why I would want to  trade an iphone in for an android. He kept going on and on about how great his iphone is and I just told him that I prefer the android and just wanted to get one already. This went on for a while and I was getting pissed that he kept fighting me on this for some reason.  It got to a point where another worker came over and asked if everything was okay. I kind of snapped and said that I just wanted to get an android, trade this phone in, and leave. The other worker apologized and took over and everything was settled within 30 mins or so. \n\nSo a couple days ago, I went back into the store to clear up a billing issue and get a new case when I got the same second worker that helped me out in the end. We talked for a bit and I found out they ended up letting the other worker go. Turns out the issue with me was the last straw. I couldn't believe it. I told a couple of my friends and some of them are thorn about it. Some think I'm TA and should have just left and come back another day. Some others think he was TA and shouldn't have pushed a product I didn't want. Reddit, AITA?\nReaction: This action is",

My mum was diagnosed with heart failure - I\u2019m devastated, and it\u2019s been particularly difficult because she\u2019s been in hospital whilst my dad, who has dementia, needs someone at home at all times to make sure he\u2019s fed, showered, clothed, well looked after, happy.\n\nNaturally, I took time off of university to look after him and visit my mum in the hospital. I love them both and I would do so much for them. Since her discharge 2 days ago I have had to juggle my part time job, university, looking after my dad. Once again, this is absolutely fine with me and I\u2019d do it all again in a heartbeat.\n\nToday is my birthday and I caught a stomach bug. I had diarrhoea and was vomiting all night until there was nothing left, so I became really dehydrated and lost quite a bit of weight. I went to the doctor so I could be prescribed something for the dehydration and pretty much slept the rest of the day, taking minimal sips of her prescribed fluids since nothing was staying down.\n\nMy family has this tradition every year where we have a birthday dinner, so the birthday person will pick a place to eat and we\u2019ll have a good time as a family. Today, my mum decided she wanted expensive gourmet burgers, but I said to her that I was really sick right now and would prefer if everyone ate something cheaper and healthier for tonight and if we could postpone the burgers for a later date when I felt better, partially because I also didn\u2019t want the smell of burgers all around also.\n\nMy doctor had told me not to eat any greasy foods. I wasn\u2019t able to keep anything down, so even though I love burgers I just knew that I would get sick if I ate them so they\u2019d be a waste.\n\nMy mum went livid. She told me she wanted burgers, and I said that was fine, but I also knew we couldn\u2019t afford a second birthday dinner since we don\u2019t have much money and that I really wanted to spend family time together, with this being my only birthday wish. She called me a selfish, childish bitch and I was very hurt by this. I had spent the entire past week trying to help my parents and I thought my birthday would be the one day where I could be allowed to be a little selfish, so I decided I needed a time out. She went out to get burgers and the beautiful cake she ordered (which I am very thankful for, since she ordered it before I was sick and there\u2019s nothing I can really do about that now).\n\nI decided to go to my boyfriend\u2019s house to study just to clear my head and get away for a little bit. I left my mum a note saying that I\u2019ll be back before 11, that I just needed some space to cool off (because this had been a really hard week for all of us) and that I loved her very much.\n\nA lot more has happened since - my Mum is really upset and telling me to leave her and my dad alone forever which really hurts me because I do love them so much and I\u2019m trying my best - I just needed a break.\n\nAm I the asshole?\nReaction: This action is",

I'm burned out of working and have been working since I was 15 years old never not having a job. \n\nI need just a little more time off. I need to do some self reflection and just want to spend time doing what I want for a little bit. She acts like I'm just sitting here louning around not doing anything, when that's not the case. \n\nShe keeps bringing up that she's supporting the both of us right now (I have money saved in our account that I kept putting in, it's not like some of that money isn't mine). \n\nI could easily get another job in the same field. \n\nShe flipped at me today for watching football and said I need a job already. I wasn't even doing anything wrong, I was just in the living room watching while she was doing other things. I don't need to hear this shit every day. I know. I flipped at her because she's been going on and on about this. She's making me feel like I'm a freeloader even though that's not the case."

We were like brothers and we used to hang out every day. He's a good guy but I recently found out he has been dating my younger sister behind my back. I didn't know until now. It was only when my sister announced they were going to get married I knew what was going on. Apparently, they have been dating for many years and engaged for 14 months without telling anyone.\n\nFast forward to today, and my sister announces she's going to get married and the wedding is next week. She invited her whole family to the wedding. I thought maybe she had been secretly dating someone maybe that's why she suddenly is going to get married. And maybe she hid it from me as she knew I would disapprove as I'm overprotective? My sister is the type of girl every guy wants (blonde hair, blue eyes and she's very pretty and has big boobs). A lot of guys hit on her and I'm afraid someone will use her or hurt her so that's why I'm overprotective. But I guess she's going to get married anyway so there's nothing I can do other than to congratulate her. However, the next thing she said shocked me: Her fiance is my best friend. Apparently, they started dating in 2014 and got engaged around Christmas 2018. After hearing this, I felt betrayed and angry. I'm disappointed in both her and my best friend, especially my best friend. No one fucks their best friend's little sister. Nobody does shit like that. To make matters even worse, they hid their relationship from me and my family for 6 years. I'm going to end the friendship with my best friend (a.k.a. future brother-in-law) for being a backstabbing piece of shit. I'm done with him.  \n\nAnyway, I told my sister that I won't go to her wedding or want to have anything to do with her soon-to-be husband and she freaked out. She wants me to walk her down the aisle and give her away (our father died three years ago and I'm her only sibling). But there is no way I'll go to her wedding. I mean my best friend is going to be my brother-in-law? It just feels too weird. So I told her to either walk down the aisle alone or find someone else to do the honor. Well, my sister started crying and begging me to come to her wedding. She says she wants my blessing. But she will never get it because I will never approve of her marriage.\n\nWe then talked with our mother and she said I'm being selfish. She also said that I should go to my sister's wedding. But I said it's my choice whether I'm going or not and no one can force me. However, my sister says I'm a horrible brother and that I hurt her feelings. I know it's her special day but I really don't want to see her fiance again.\n\nAm I the asshole?\nReaction: This action is",

Neither him nor I pay rent, but I pay for my own school and much of my own living expenses, in addition to contributions to the household like helping with groceries and items for around the house such as Kleenex, paper towels, or q-tips.\n\nMy brother is taking online courses which in his own words are 'very cheap' and he works 4 days a week. He barely buys his own stuff, let alone for the household. My mom buys his soap, food, bus passes, etc. He even tries to eat my food I've labeled 'NoNo' (as in 'No Noelle (my name)' - don't eat). It really pisses me off that he eats my food, takes my stuff & doesn't contribute anything. I'm fed up with it. I've brought it up to my mom several times and she always says \"I know\" or \"I can't make him contribute\" or \"I don't want to cause an argument.\"\n\nI buy q-tips to help me apply my makeup. No one else tends to use them as my parents say they're not good to stick in your ears. The other day, my brother said his ears 'felt dirty' and did we have any q-tips. I said no. Later he went into the bathroom and saw q-tips sitting in my makeup drawer. He asked if I'd forgotten I had them. I said no I hadn't but I didn't want to share them. He was like 'um excuse me.' I told him he needs to start buying his own toiletries and food and start contributing to the house more, and that it's not fair we have to buy things to support him too.

            "subject": "AITA for choosing q-tips as a hill to die on? | I am a female university student (20) living with my parents and older brother. Neither him nor I pay rent, but I pay for my own school and much of my own living expenses, in addition to contributions to the household like helping with groceries and items for around the house such as Kleenex, paper towels, or q-tips.\n\nMy brother is taking online courses which in his own words are 'very cheap' and he works 4 days a week. He barely buys his own stuff, let alone for the household. My mom buys his soap, food, bus passes, etc. He even tries to eat my food I've labeled 'NoNo' (as in 'No Noelle (my name)' - don't eat). It really pisses me off that he eats my food, takes my stuff & doesn't contribute anything. I'm fed up with it. I've brought it up to my mom several times and she always says \"I know\" or \"I can't make him contribute\" or \"I don't want to cause an argument.\"\n\nI buy q-tips to help me apply my makeup. No one else tends to use them as my parents say they're not good to stick in your ears. The other day, my brother said his ears 'felt dirty' and did we have any q-tips. I said no. Later he went into the bathroom and saw q-tips sitting in my makeup drawer. He asked if I'd forgotten I had them. I said no I hadn't but I didn't want to share them. He was like 'um excuse me.' I told him he needs to start buying his own toiletries and food and start contributing to the house more, and that it's not fair we have to buy things to support him too. He works, and frankly makes more money than me yet has less expenses because his schooling is barely $400/semester vs my upwards of $4000. \n\nHe freaked out on me and said I'm a selfish bitch for not letting him use q-tips of all things, and that I wouldn't act this way with mom or dad.
